Don't Even Blink: An Experiment
===============

##Brief
A library called [headtracker](https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr) has come out that does face/head detection in JavaScript using WebRTC / getUserMedia. This functionality is enabled by the library [CCV by Liu Liu](https://github.com/liuliu/ccv), which is what this blink-tracker will be based on.

##Description
Doctor Who fans are likely familiar with the [Weeping Angels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeping_Angel), an ancient alien race from the popular sci-fi series. Essentially, if you blink the normally stone angels unfreeze and end your existence in one of several unpleasant ways.

This experiment uses blink detection to simulate a real angel encounter!

##Trademarks & Such
This is entirely for fun / learning purposes and should be covered under fair use. I think? If anybody has any kind of infringement issue, please contact me and I'll take this down immediately.
